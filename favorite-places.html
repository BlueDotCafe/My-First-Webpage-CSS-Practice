    <h1>These are some of our <br><em>favorite</em> places to visit.</h1>

    <h2>
      Travel can be expensive. But we love to dream. I personally love to dream about Paris.<br> Why am I not there? Here are some other places that
      we both would love to visit.

    <ul>
      <li>Lima, Peru</li>
      <li>London, UK. We must visit Abbey Road.</li>
      <li>Hong Kong sounds so cool.</li>
      <li>Paris is still a must. But I really need a black stripey dress and red shoes.</li>
      <li>Joshua Tree, California. The stillness is zen and peaceful.</li>
    </ul>

      Lima can be a beautiful place. This picture of Larco Mar is right on the beach and a hot tourist destination.

      If I had a white linen suit like John, we could re-inact the famous Beatles photo. Jordan said that he would willing to be Paul.

      I hear the food is good in Hong Kong. But don't try eating while walking down it's crowded streets.

      In my dream, I work as a couture seamstress at the famous House of Channel. Karl Lagerfeld would not be willing to dress me because I am not a size 6.

      Joshua Tree is my happy place where I don't have to think about anything but the here and now.
