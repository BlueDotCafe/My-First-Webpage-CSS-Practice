    <h1>These are some of our <em>favorite</em> places to visit.</h1>
    <p>
      Travel can be expensive. But we love to dream. I personally love to
      dream about Paris.<br> Why am I not there? Here are some other places that
      we both would love to visit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lima, Peru</li>
      <li>London, UK. We must visit Abbey Road.</li>
      <li>Hong Kong sounds so cool.</li>
      <li>Paris is still a must. But I really need a black stripey dress and red shoes.</li>
      <li>Joshua Tree, California. The stillness is zen and peaceful.</li>
